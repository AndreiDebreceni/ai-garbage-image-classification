We have 6 classes of images spread in 6 folders and we have 6 types of items:
-carboard
-glass
-metal
-paper
-plastic
-trash

We need to analize the data:
-check distribution of files
-image resolution
-aspect ratio
-file format type

We need to aggregate the file name with their respective label in a tabular form.
1. Let's define label codes.
-carboard = 0
-glass = 1
-metal = 2
-paper = 3
-plastic = 4
-trash = 5




Questions:

Our datas are fully labeled?
What we should do with "trash"
